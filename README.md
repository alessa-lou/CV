I have a rather eclectic background, from working at a farm to doing marketing and social media for an alternative fashion brand. Throughout these jobs I have always sought to organise, streamline and make things more efficient, whether that is by setting up a feeding rota for animals or by streamlining the postal system for website orders. 

Problem solving is something I find incredibly rewarding and I think it was this that led me to do a coding bootcamp. Makers Academy helped me develop skills such as agile working practices, Test Driven Development, collaborating on projects, rapid learning, honing a process, and attention to detail. I am excited to embark on this new career as a full-stack software developer.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving

Whilst working at [Matlock Farm Park](https://matlockfarmpark.co.uk) there was a whole host of things that could go wrong in any given day - what do they say? Never work with children or animals? Working with both meant that I often needed to think on my feet, whether that was accomodating large groups of children into a small barn due to a freak snow storm and keeping them entertained whilst we waited it out for 45 minutes, or using a handy wheelbarrow to temporarily block up a hole in a fence to stop the sheep escaping.

A less stressful example of problem solving on the farm was when I overhauled the feeding system. I ordered a feed bucket for each animal and a large white board where I marked out a section for each animal, what it needed to eat, any medicinces that needed administering, etc. This meant that less food was wasted, each animal was getting the correct amount of food and hence fewer vet bills, and no one was getting over fed or under fed. 


#### Collaboration
#### Rapid Learning
#### Public Speaking

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

Other useful things to mention:
Times you used tech to automate functions;
Leading Teams;
Presenting Skills;
Getting Things Done;
