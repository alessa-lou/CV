I am a full stack junior developer with an enthusiastic interest in environmental science, in particular, the ways in which modern technology can help relieve the pressures of the current climate crisis. With experience working in Python, Ruby and JavaScript, examples of my projects can be found below.

I have a diverse background, from doing a BSc Zoology degree, to working at a farm, to doing marketing and social media for an alternative fashion brand. Throughout these jobs I have always sought to organise, streamline and make things more efficient, whether that is by setting up a feeding rota for animals or by streamlining the system for website orders.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving

Whilst working at [Matlock Farm Park](https://matlockfarmpark.co.uk) there was a whole host of things that could go wrong in any given day - what do they say? Never work with children or animals?! Working with both meant that I often needed to think on my feet, whether that was accomodating large groups of children into a small barn due to a freak snow storm and keeping them entertained whilst we waited it out for 45 minutes, or using a handy wheelbarrow to temporarily block up a hole in a fence to stop the sheep escaping.

During my time at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech), problem solving was also a key part of the course. Whilst pairing during our [AirBnB clone](https://github.com/04alexklink/makersbnb) group project, me and my pair partner were trying to set the ID of our user once their log-in details had been authenticated, but we were struggling to work out how to do so. I suggested that we followed the flow and, using print statements, we worked out what was being returned from the database, and how we could access the ID number from the PG result object. It was a very satisfying moment!


#### Collaboration

Throughout my career teamwork and collaboration has been very important, for example when I worked at the farm we had a big annual Highland Games event which typically took over a thousand visitors. This event meant all hands on deck as the entire farm had to be tidy and everything needed to run efficiently to schedule. By organising the staff and volunteers with a scheduled timetable, and communicating frequently via two-way radios throughout the day, the event usually ran without a hiccough! 

Additionally my time at Makers Academy has been incredibly collaborative with pairing sessions happening most afternoons, and the final month or so taken up by group projects. The group projects taught me that using Agile methods and XP values are vital to the running of a team. My final group project, (our web app spotiVibes), was particularly challenging due to our need for three different APIs to work together. This caused some stress and tension in the group but during our end of day retro we were able to voice our concerns and make appropriate changes for the rest of the week so that everyone's needs were met.

#### Rapid Learning

Rapid learning has been a feature of my entire career, for example in my previous job at [Asylum Retail](https://www.damagedsociety.co.uk) I learnt how to use Photoshop to make eye-catching, attractive website banners and newsletters within a few months. My love of learning was put to the test during Makers Academy where I went from knowing very minimal Ruby to building an entire web app in JavaScript using three external APIs in 12 weeks (and we didn't even start learning JavaScript until week five).

- As I have a background in STEM I particularly enjoyed running workshops on insect and pond ecology in the wildlife garden with small groups of customers and larger groups of up to 100 school children.
- Overseeing volunteers and work experience students allowed me to build on my communication skills. Making sure that the students were learning and enjoying themselves as well as completing useful tasks was particularly rewarding.
- My public speaking skills really improved during my time at the farm - I did daily animal talks in front of large crowds of people or school trips consisting of up to 100 children.
